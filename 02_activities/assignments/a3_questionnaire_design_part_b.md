     Comment on the Quality of the Sample:

The quality of the sample is inherently tied to the number of sample units included. While the Simple Random Sampling technique aims to eliminate bias and ensure every employee within each stratum has an equal chance of selection, achieving perfect representativeness remains a challenge. 

The sample is not expected to be perfectly representative of the target population for several reasons:

1. Sample Size: A smaller sample size may not capture the diversity within the population, leading to potential inaccuracies. Without a large enough sample, the results may not accurately reflect the views and experiences of the entire target group.
   
2. Targeted Representation: While the sampling method aims to capture sentiments from entry-level and lower-level positions, unless a substantial portion of these groups is surveyed, their perspectives might still be underrepresented.
   
3. Random Variability: Even with a random sampling technique, there is always an element of randomness that might result in certain groups being slightly over or underrepresented purely by chance.

To improve representativeness, targeting a larger sample size of the sampling frameâ€”would enhance the likelihood of accurately reflecting the target population's characteristics and sentiments.

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

 Revised Survey:
1. How long have you been employed at this company?
2. What factors contributed to your decision to join this company?
3. Are you satisfied with your current role? Yes/No
4. If you are not satisfied with your current role, please explain why:
5. What factors would enhance your satisfaction with the company? (Select all that apply) 
    - Higher Pay 
    - Improved Benefits 
    - Career Development Opportunities 
    - Better Work/Life Balance 
    - Positive Office Culture
    - More Flexible Working Hours
6. Do you feel that your work is recognized and appreciated by the management? Yes/No
7. How would you rate the ethical standards of the company? (1 - Very Poor, 5 - Excellent)

 Changes and Reasoning:

1. Added Question 4: "If you are not satisfied with your current role, please explain why."
   - Reason: This provides qualitative data that can help understand specific reasons behind dissatisfaction, which can be useful for making targeted improvements.

2. Added Option in Question 5: "More Flexible Working Hours"
   - Reason: Flexibility is an important aspect of job satisfaction for many employees. Including this option can help identify if this is a significant factor for the workforce.

3. Added Question 6: "Do you feel that your work is recognized and appreciated by the management? Yes/No"
   - Reason: Recognition and appreciation are crucial for employee morale and satisfaction. This question helps assess the company's performance in this area.

4. Added Question 7: "How would you rate the ethical standards of the company? (1 - Very Poor, 5 - Excellent)"
   - Reason: Ethics play a vital role in the overall perception of a company. This question gauges employee views on the company's ethical practices.

These changes aim to address potential gaps in the original survey by providing more detailed insights into employee satisfaction and the ethical climate of the company.

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```
    write your answer here...
    No, the purpose of our survey could not have been fulfilled through an observational study. The goal of the survey is to understand the reasons behind the high turnover rate and to identify changes needed to improve employee satisfaction. Achieving this requires direct input from employees about their experiences and perspectives.
    
    In an observational study, we wouldn't be able to directly ask employees about their reasons for dissatisfaction or the specific changes they would like to see. The data collected would be based on observed behaviors and inferred motivations, which might not accurately capture the underlying issues. Direct feedback from employees is crucial for understanding their specific concerns and needs, something that an observational study would not effectively provide.
